# Flight Data Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This repository contains the results of an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted on flight data. The EDA aims to provide valuable insights and patterns within the dataset, allowing for a better understanding of flight-related information. The analysis includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and data exploration to answer questions and discover trends.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains historical flight data, including information such as flight numbers, departure and arrival locations, flight durations, delays, and more. The dataset was collected from [source].

### Key Objectives

The primary objectives of this EDA project are as follows:

1. **Data Exploration:** Understand the structure and characteristics of the flight dataset, including data types, missing values, and basic statistics.

2. **Visualization:** Create informative and visually appealing charts, graphs, and plots to represent various aspects of flight data.

3. **Descriptive Statistics:** Compute descriptive statistics to summarize key features of the dataset.

4. **Trends and Patterns:** Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies within the flight data.

5. **Insights:** Provide insights and findings based on the analysis that may be relevant to stakeholders, travelers, and aviation authorities.
